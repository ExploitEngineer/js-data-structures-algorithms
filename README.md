# 📚 DSA with JavaScript

Welcome to **DSA with JavaScript**, a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms concepts, patterns, and problems – all solved in JavaScript.

This repository is maintained by [ExploitEngineer](https://github.com/ExploitEngineer) and is built for **beginners and intermediate learners** looking to master DSA for technical interviews, coding contests, and real-world problem solving.
